## Some notes about the implementation of DDD + Clean Architecture.  
  
At the begining of the project the time taken to structure is way more than a MVC or 
Layers architecture. However, as the project evolves it gets faster and faster to 
build up applications and features.  
The abstractions for repository, and separation of concerns make things clean and fast.
