Real professional APIs follow this

Stripe, Notion, GitHub all do:

POST   /resource/subresource
PATCH  /resource/subresource/:id
DELETE /resource/subresource/:id

POST   /workouts
GET    /workouts/:id

POST   /workouts/:id/sets            → add set
DELETE /workouts/:id/sets            → remove many sets
PATCH  /workouts/:id/sets/:setId     → edit reps/weight/name

Key architectural principle

You are not designing endpoints.

You are exposing aggregate capabilities over HTTP.

So the question becomes:

“What can the Workout do?”
not
“What fields exist in the database?”
